Compared to older protocols like OpenVPN or IPsec, it uses far less code (around 4,000 lines), which means a smaller attack surface, easier security auditing, and noticeably faster connection speeds and battery life. MyWireGuard uses this protocol to encrypt all of your traffic and route it through our global server network.',

        'shared-vs-dedicated-answer-intro': 'These are our two core plans to meet different user needs:',
        'shared-vs-dedicated-shared': 'Shared Nodes: You will share server resources and IP addresses with other users. This is the most cost-effective choice, perfect for daily anonymous browsing, securing public WiFi, and accessing general websites.',
        'shared-vs-dedicated-dedicated': 'Dedicated Lines: You will get a VPN tunnel completely reserved for you personally and a **fixed dedicated IP address**. This means:',
        'shared-vs-dedicated-stable': 'More stable performance: Bandwidth is exclusively for you, unaffected by others\' activities.',

        'receive-config-answer': 'After you complete checkout, we automatically generate a personal .conf configuration file for your selected plan and server location, and email it to the address you provided — usually within a few minutes. Just download the attached file and import it into the official WireGuard client (or TunnlTo) to connect. See our Tutorials page for step-by-step import instructions.',
        'change-location-question': 'Can I change my server location?',
        'change-location-answer': 'Yes. On the Shared Nodes plan, you can download a new .conf file for any other location from your customer center at any time. On a Dedicated Line, since your dedicated IP is tied to a specific physical location, changing regions requires provisioning a new IP — please contact our support team and we\'ll set up the new location for you, usually within a few hours.',
